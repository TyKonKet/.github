## 🔐 Security Standards

### Secure Development Practices

We follow industry-standard secure development practices:

- **Code Reviews**: All code changes require peer review
- **Static Analysis**: Automated security scanning on all commits
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular checks for vulnerable dependencies
- **Secret Scanning**: Prevention of hardcoded secrets in code
- **Secure Defaults**: Configurations are secure by default

### Security Testing

- **Unit Testing**: Security-focused unit tests
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end security validation
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular security assessments
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated and manual security scans

## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

### 📧 How to Report

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly using one of these methods:

**🔒 Preferred: Private Security Advisory** (Recommended for sensitive vulnerabilities)
- Go to the [Security tab](../../security) of the repository
- Click "Report a vulnerability" 
- Create a private security advisory
- This keeps the vulnerability confidential until we can address it

**💬 Alternative: GitHub Discussions**
- Use our [Security Discussion category](../../discussions/categories/security)
- For less sensitive security questions or general security discussions
- Public visibility - only use for non-sensitive security topics

**🐛 Public Issue** (Only for non-sensitive security improvements)
- Create a regular issue with the `security` label
- Use only for general security enhancements, not actual vulnerabilities

### 🔒 Secure Reporting Guidelines

**For Sensitive Vulnerabilities:**
- ✅ Use GitHub's private security advisory feature
- ✅ Keep details confidential until we respond
- ✅ Provide detailed reproduction steps
- ❌ Do not disclose publicly until we've had time to fix

**For General Security Questions:**
- ✅ Use GitHub Discussions in the Security category
- ✅ Ask about security best practices
- ✅ Discuss security features or improvements

## ⚡ Security Response Process

### 📅 Response Timeline

| Phase | Timeline | Actions |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Acknowledgment** | 24 hours | Initial response and case number assignment |
| **Assessment** | 72 hours | Vulnerability validation and severity assessment |
| **Investigation** | 1-2 weeks | Root cause analysis and impact assessment |
| **Resolution** | 2-4 weeks | Fix development and testing |
| **Disclosure** | After fix | Public disclosure and security advisory |

### 🔍 Assessment Criteria

We use the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v3.1 to assess severity:

- **Critical (9.0-10.0)**: Immediate attention required
- **High (7.0-8.9)**: Important vulnerabilities requiring prompt attention
- **Medium (4.0-6.9)**: Moderate vulnerabilities
- **Low (0.1-3.9)**: Minor vulnerabilities

### 📢 Communication

- **Acknowledgment**: We'll confirm receipt within 24 hours
- **Updates**: Regular updates on investigation progress
- **Resolution**: Notification when a fix is available
- **Public Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure after resolution

### 🔄 Resolution Process

1. **Verification**: Confirm the vulnerability exists
2. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate impact and exploitability
3. **Fix Development**: Create and test security patch
4. **Review**: Security team and maintainer review
5. **Deployment**: Release fix to supported versions
6. **Disclosure**: Public security advisory publication

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices
